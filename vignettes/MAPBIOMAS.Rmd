## The Dataset

The MAPBIOMAS project gathers data reporting the type of land covering each year by area, that is, for example, the area used for a temporary crop of soybeans. It also reports the transition between coverings during given years.

The data available has an yearly frequency and is available starting from the year 1989.

## Usage
Using the function is easy enough:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(datazoom.amazonia)

# Download treated data from Mapbiomas Cover in english
data = load_mapbiomas(dataset = "mapbimas_cover",
                      raw_data = FALSE, geo_level = "municipality",
                      time_period = "all", language = "eng")

# Download treated data from Mapbiomas Irrigation in portuguese
data = load_mapbiomas(dataset = "mapbimas_irrigation",
                      raw_data = FALSE, geo_level = "municipality",
                      time_period = "all", language = "pt")
```
